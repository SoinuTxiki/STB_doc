FreePiano is an opensource MIDI keyboard software.

In the beginning, this software was made just for myself, I just wanted a program that could load VSTi instruments and play like a piano using my computer keyboard.

After version 1.0, I have been receiving lots of suggestions, which make this software better and better. Thanks to all the suggestions.

If I could find similar open source software, maybe I will just make modifications on that software. So FreePiano is opensource. I hope new ideas can be implemented in this software, if it is possible.
